# TextVue
TextVue is an app that allows you to parse all kinds of texts from your environment. Whether your content is live, still, or imported from your camera roll, by using advanced text recognition API and AI denoising techniques TextVue can see even when there's nothing to see, and with the
 power of augmented reality, discovering the world around you and grabbing text to use in other applications with the tap of a finger never seemed so easy. Welcome home to innovation, where we all should be.
